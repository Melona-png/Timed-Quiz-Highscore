# Timed Quiz Highscore Challenge

This application loads a timed quiz that decrements time when the incorrect answer is selected, and incrememnts time when the correct answer is selected.
The questions can be changed as needed. 

#Description
I created this quiz with Javascript through local storage and data selectors. I used local storage to allow users to save their scores on a leaderboard.
